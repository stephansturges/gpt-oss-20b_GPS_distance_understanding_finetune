list of open points
1. It would be cool to add orientation to the dataset, so that our LLM learns to predict something like "X kilometers towards the SE"
2. There's no reason not to add a LOT more diversity including different languages to the basic prompt structure
3. We could include different reference formats for the GPS points and different ways to calculate distance (acknowledging this goes beyond the idea of building a dataset that tries to teach _intuition_ about distance, so a little out of scope).
